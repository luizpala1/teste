My teaching activities began in 2012, during my doctorate at ESALQ/USP. There, I had the opportunity to teach undergraduate courses to students from different areas. In 2015, I was admitted as a professor at UFLA, where I teach at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

I have been taking courses in English as a Medium of Instruction, which has encouraged me to teach content in English to students at our institution and at partners who are not native English speakers. The course in this format is "Data manipulation and visualization", where I teach Exploratory Data Analysis using R.
